# [Tour de Tohoku] Collab Repo
A collaboration channel for [Tour de Tohoku] team.

## Guidelines

To save everyone's email inboxes, [let's create issues](https://github.com/mapbox/tour-de-tohoku/issues) here in the repo whenever we have questions regarding tech, product, implementation, process, etc.

All issue posts will create notifications to the team.

We'll also create a project board to track status as tickets are created, investigated, discussed, and closed.



### Useful tips

1. All text is formatted in markdown. This makes it easy to do bullets, links, embed pictures and more: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics.

2. Please create a separate issue for each new conversation.

3. Please cc **[Tomo Yamazaki]** on all issues for visibility across teams and to ensure a fast response.

4. Use priority, product, and type labels for better triaging and Mapbox will use a project board to denote progress stages through issues.

5. Don't be shy about closing issues that are resolved or no longer relevant.
